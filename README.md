# Learning-RPS-Game ðŸ˜±

_I've made a singleplayer "Rock Paper Scissors" game, in which as you keep playing, the bot you compete against will "learn" how to make you lose every round. :)_

In order to play the game yourself, you can open the **main.py** file, copy the code, paste it in another python file on your PC and then run it.

_**IF THERE ARE ANY BUGS TO THIS GAME, YOU CAN CONTACT ME ON DISCORD (GalaXy#6509)**_
